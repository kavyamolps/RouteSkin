    <b class="b3" style="margin-left: 10%;font-size: 25px;">Here's a step-by-step guide to determining your skin type at home:</b>
    <div class="skintypefind1">
        <ol style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%;margin-top: 4%;margin-bottom: 4%;">
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Cleanse Your Face:</b>Start with a clean face. Use a gentle cleanser to remove any makeup, dirt, or oil.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Wait for One Hour:</b>Allow your skin to return to its natural state for about an hour. Avoid touching your face during this time.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Observe Your Skin:</b>After an hour, observe how your skin feels and looks. Pay attention to these characteristics:
        <ul class="b2" style="margin-left: 5%;">
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Dry Skin:</b>If your skin feels tight, flaky, or rough, especially around the cheeks, you likely have dry skin.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Oily Skin:</b>If your skin looks shiny or greasy, especially in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin), and feels slick to the touch, you likely have oily skin.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Combination Skin:</b>If you notice that some areas of your face are dry while others are oily, you likely have combination skin. Typically, the T-zone is oily while the cheeks are dry.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Normal Skin:</b>If your skin feels balanced, not too oily or dry, and looks clear and healthy, you likely have normal skin.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Perform a Blotting Test (Optional):</b>If you're unsure about your skin type, you can perform a blotting test. Press a clean tissue against different areas of your face, focusing on the forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin.
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
        <li><b class="b1">Oily Skin:</b>If the tissue picks up oil or grease, especially in the T-zone, you likely have oily skin.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Dry Skin:</b>If the tissue doesn't pick up much oil, and your skin feels tight or dry afterward, you likely have dry skin.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Combination Skin:</b>If some areas of the tissue show oil while others do not, you likely have combination skin.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Normal Skin:</b>If there's minimal oil on the tissue and your skin feels comfortable afterward, you likely have normal skin.</li>
        <br>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b class="b1">Consider Other Factors:</b>Take note of any other skin concerns you may have, such as sensitivity, acne, or aging signs. These can influence your overall skin type and help guide your skincare routine.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <b style="margin-left: 10%;font-size: 25px;">To determine if you have sensitive skin, follow these steps:</b>
    <div class="skintypefind2">
        <br>
        <ol style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%;margin-top: 4%;margin-bottom: 4%;">
        <li><b class="b1">Patch Test:</b>Choose a small, inconspicuous area of your skin, such as behind your ear or on the inner forearm. Apply a small amount of a new skincare product or ingredient you're testing.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Wait 24 Hours:</b>Leave the product on your skin for 24 hours without washing it off. During this time, avoid applying any other skincare products to the test area.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Observe for Reactions:</b>After 24 hours, observe the test area for any signs of irritation, redness, itching, burning, or discomfort. These reactions may indicate sensitivity to the product or ingredient.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Repeat with Different Products:</b>If you have multiple skincare products you suspect may be causing sensitivity, repeat the patch test process for each product, using a separate test area for each one.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Note Sensations:</b>Pay attention to how your skin feels during and after the patch test. Sensations like stinging, tingling, or tightness can also indicate sensitivity.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Consider Past Experiences:</b>Reflect on any previous instances where your skin reacted negatively to skincare products or environmental factors. If you've experienced sensitivity before, it's likely that you have sensitive skin.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b class="b1">Consult a Dermatologist:</b>If you're unsure or experience persistent skin sensitivity, consult a dermatologist. They can provide a professional assessment and recommend suitable skincare products and routines tailored to your skin's needs.</li>
        </ol>
